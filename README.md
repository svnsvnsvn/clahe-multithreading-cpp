# CLAHE Multithreading (C++ Project)

Starting from a single-threaded implementation of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), this project explores performance improvements using multithreading.

## TODO

- Add build instructions
- Add performance benchmarks
- Implement multithreading optimizations
- Compare single-threaded vs multithreaded performance
